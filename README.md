# Clinic-Customer-Support-Workflow
I've developed a chatbot that can read and answer mail of customer, based on the custom data set that was fed into the bot. It is generally simple to develop chatbot to answer gmail automatically, but the quality of the reply depends largely on the quality of the knowledge based that that chatbot employed to answer. The more articulate, specifics and the more topics the knowledge base covers, the more accurately the chatbot can answer customer's question. 

In case of large knowledge based it is recommended to vectorize the data base (which is what I did) for faster access and processing time.  Since vectorization and moving it to vector store is more of a one-time event, the activity is not included in the workflow.

By building this chatbot, business can save time and effort to reply to new customer questions, leaving them the time to focus on more important tasks. 

Below you can find the sample input and output of this chatbot I've build to support a fictional clinics, knowledge base is based on FAQs website of Praxis Drewitz in Essen: https://www.praxis-drewitz.de/behandlungen/allgemeinmedizin/
